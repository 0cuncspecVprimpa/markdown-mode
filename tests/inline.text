This is *italic.*
This is **bold.**
This is `code`.
This is ``code`containing`backticks``.

Seven backquotes in a string ``````` results in three backquotes
in an inline code span.

A backslash as the final character in an inline code fragment does
*not* escape the backquote.  That is, `C-h C-\` will render as

    <code>C-h C-\</code>
